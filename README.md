# UNO score counter in React native

A quick and dirty project to try out react native for the first time. Basically allows a user to add players and scores which are stored in a redux store. These can be cleared and incremented etc.

The project uses Creat React Native as a starting point with redux added. I didn't use any component libraries etc as it was just for basic experimenting.
